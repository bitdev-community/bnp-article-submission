import { ComponentShowcase } from "./component-showcase";

### Component usage

You must pass the component id to the `<ComponentShowcase>` component:

```js
<ComponentShowcase componentId="teambit.wiki/apps/wiki@1.90.20" />
```

It will render an Iframe with the component's preview, dependencies graph, and code tab.

You can also pass a ReactNode to the preview tab. You can use this when you need better performance than the default preview.
Additionally, you can use it to render a specific composition of the component.
In order for the component to display the dependencies graph and code tab, you must still pass the component id.

```js
<ComponentShowcase
  componentId="teambit.wiki/apps/wiki@1.90.20"
  preview={<WikiApp />}
/>
```

### Try it yourself!

Try it yourself by adding any of the following components id to the `<ComponentShowcase>` component.

- `teambit.design/basic/button`
- `teambit.verified-demo/pages/favourites`
- `teambit.design/blocks/header`

```jsx live
<ComponentShowcase componentId="teambit.community/apps/bit-dev" />
```
